# Test-File-Generator

This is bash script that you can use to generate test files(both input and output) for a given problem.<br>
## Prerequisites : 
You will have to have the test generation file and the source code file ready beforehand to use this.<br>
## Usage :
Once ready, all you have to do is run the script using the command <code> ./script.sh </code> and this will run the file.<br>
After doing this, you will need to do as the commands say and voila! Your test files will be ready in the blink of an eye!<br>

# Version 1 :
Doesn't have much error detection ablility (to detect false filenames, overwriting a file etc...) as of now but will be added in the future.<br>
The script however still works flawlessly and reliably.

# Version 2 :
Added the ability to erase and overwrite old directories named input and output and also fixed a bug in the output file generation loop.
